# speeddialback

Shows a home page with 3 buttons that navigate to 3 other pages.

1. The first page is just a standard Scaffold. You will be able to swipe to navigate back to the home page.
1. The second page uses a `SpeedDial`. Swiping back no longer works for some reason.
1. The third page uses a standard Flutter `FloatinActionButton`. You will be able to swipe to navigate back to the home page.
